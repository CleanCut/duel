This repo was prepared as the proof-of-concept for what we built _together_ in the
[Rusty Sword Arena](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_sword_arena)
[session at OSCON 2018](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67116)

There is a TAG for each of the relevant sections, starting with tag `03` and then `04` and so forth.  If you get
completely lost or behind in the tutorial, you can clone this repo and checkout the closest tag, and go from there if 
you like.

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CleanCut/duel.git

# Look at the tags 
cd duel
git tag

# Check out one of the tags
git checkout 08

# ...and off you go
```
